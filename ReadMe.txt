This is a very basic script to report vulnerabilities to application owners through the Acunetix API. Older versions of Acunetix do not have great reporting features - this helps with that. 

The script assumes application owners are listed in the "description" field of the web application in the scanner. This version only reports high-severity vulnerabilities found in web applications that are on a recurring scanning schedule. Two versions of emails are sent out. The first goes to the application owners and includes the report of their application only. The second includes every report and a total count of high-severity vulnerabilities but the recipient(s) must be statically written. Ideally this would be set on a cron some time after a scheduled scan. Refer to the Acunetix API docs to make minor changes to what severity is being reported.
